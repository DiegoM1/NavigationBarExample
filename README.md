#Storyboards
        

An easy example to understand how navigation Controller works, Im using storyboard, when you press a button its change 
the abributte of the destination view controller. It happen using prepareForSegue , Its a default method when you are using
storyBoard. Also I added a SearchController as the titleView of my navigation Controller. You need to hide the searchController 
if you want to show the destionation View Controller.
